## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently completing my formal education but I like to think of myself as always being a student, regardless of classload.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my low level programming skills. If you know assembly then everything is open source.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my travel blog! I built it with friends from scratch, and then proceeded to have very little time to travel anymore let alone write about it.
